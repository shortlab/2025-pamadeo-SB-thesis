"The Effect of Simultaneous Proton Irradiation and Corrosion on Stainless Steel exposed to Liquid Lead-Bismuth at 675Â°C"

Sample Images: SEM images of all 3 samples ("Main Images") and selected areas near the surface ("Surface Selection Images") at different percents of total image thickness

Stastical_Analyses_Corrosion: .ijm file to process the thresholded images in FIJI and output the corrosion depth

Outputs: .csv files of the output for the whole images ("Full Image Outputs") and of selected areas near the surface ("Surface Selection Outputs"). The latter outputs were each split into six sections and the fraction of corroded surface pixels averaged for statistical significance ("Surface Selection Averaging")

Graphs: graphs of the corrosion depth CDF of each full image ("Full Image Graphs") and the selected areas near the surface ("Surface Area Graphs")

Deepest Corrosion Points: graph of 10% deepest corrosion depths in each full image sample.
