Data repository for Paola Amadeo's Bachelor's of Science thesis in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, "The Effect of Simultaneous Proton Irradiation and Corrosion on Stainless Steel exposed to Liquid Lead-Bismuth at 675Â°C"

[1-Sample-Images](1-Sample-Images/): SEM images of all 3 samples [Full-Images](1-Sample-Images/Full-Images/), both as originally taken ("piece images") and stitched into a long image, as well as selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Images](1-Sample-Images/Surface-Selection-Images/) at different percents of total image thickness

[2-Stastical-Analyses-Corrosion](2-Statistical-Analyses-Corrosion.ijm): .ijm file to process the thresholded images in FIJI and output the corrosion depth

[3-Outputs](3-Outputs): .csv files of the output for the whole images [Full-Image-Outputs](3-Outputs/Full-Image-Outputs) and of selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Outputs](3-Outputs/Surface-Selection-Outputs). The latter outputs were each split into six sections and the fraction of corroded surface pixels averaged for statistical significance [Surface-Selection-Averaging](3-Outputs/Surface-Selection-Averaging)

[4-Graphs](4-Graphs): graphs of the corrosion depth CDF of each full image [Full-Image-Graphs](4-Graphs/Full-Image-Graphs) and the selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Graphs](4-Graphs/Surface-Selection-Graphs.xlsx). [Deepest-Corrosion-Points](4-Graphs/Deepest-Corrosion-Points.xlsx): graph of 10% deepest corrosion depths in each full image sample.
