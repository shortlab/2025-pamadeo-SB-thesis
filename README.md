"The Effect of Simultaneous Proton Irradiation and Corrosion on Stainless Steel exposed to Liquid Lead-Bismuth at 675Â°C"

[1-Sample-Images](1-Sample-Images/): SEM images of all 3 samples [Full-Images](1-Sample-Images/Full-Images/), both as originally taken and stitched into a long image, as well as selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Images](1-Sample-Images/Surface-Selection-Images/) at different percents of total image thickness

[4-Stastical-Analyses-Corrosion](4-Statistical-Analyses-Corrosion.ijm): .ijm file to process the thresholded images in FIJI and output the corrosion depth

[2-Outputs](2-Outputs): .csv files of the output for the whole images [Full-Image-Outputs](2-Outputs/Full-Image-Outputs) and of selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Outputs](2-Outputs/Surface-Selection-Outputs). The latter outputs were each split into six sections and the fraction of corroded surface pixels averaged for statistical significance [Surface-Selection-Averaging](2-Outputs/Surface-Selection-Averaging)

[3-Graphs](3-Graphs): graphs of the corrosion depth CDF of each full image [Full-Image-Graphs](3-Graphs/Full-Image-Graphs) and the selected areas near the surface [Surface-Selection-Graphs](3-Graphs/Surface-Selection-Graphs.xlsx). [Deepest-Corrosion-Points](3-Graphs/Deepest-Corrosion-Points.xlsx): graph of 10% deepest corrosion depths in each full image sample.
